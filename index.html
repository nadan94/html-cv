    <!--Paragraph about me-->

      <p>I have recently completed my BCom: Accounting (C2) degree at the Nelson Mandela University as well as the Software Engineering boot-camp with Hyperion Dev. My goal has always been to pursue a career in commerce, especially the tech side of things. I enjoy learning new skills and am currently looking to further enhance my skill set with practical experience. I have a passion for computing and technology and even though I am new to the field my drive to continue learning more about it is second to none. </p></td>
